                                          My journey with TA has been serendipitous. I did not know anything about it, till I stumbled upon it more than a year back. Since then, my life has been churning and changing in ways that I know will have a deep impact on me.

                      <p style="text-align: justify;">It is only fitting then that this beautiful SAATA conference took place just when I had almost finished my Diploma. Since I did the course online, there was a feeling of disconnectedness with the TA community. I was missing a bond, a sense of belonging to the community into which I had just stepped. And at this juncture, I signed up for the conference. And what a beautiful, warm space I found it to be.</p>
                      <p style="text-align: justify;">It was so heart-warming to finally meet my teachers and mentors after spending such an
                          intense year with them having interacted only virtually. I felt a warm rush of love, acceptance, and belonging. The spirit and energy at the conference were invigorating, with every participant just so happy to be present. There was palpable comradery and joy in the experience of a shared passion for mental and emotional well-being and for TA.
                          </p>
                     
                      <p style="text-align: justify;">Karen Minikin’s opening talk on the impact of the political and social climate on an individual’s mental health and well-being set the right tone for the conference. She poignantly brought to life the struggles of political alienation on entire generations of people and the trauma that it results in, asking the very important question of how much of an onus of our mental health and emotional well-being lies with our society.</p>
                      <p style="text-align: justify;">Another talk that I really enjoyed was Dr. Ram’s honest sharing of his learnings of working with children. It was the simplicity and humility with which he approached his subject that engaged me the most, and the takeaway that stayed with me, was what makes children resilient is trust and acceptance from others. And that we are all born okay - knowing and believing it, and finding our way back to it.</p>
                      <p style="text-align: justify;">With this, I also connected with Surayaprakash’s workshop on Physis, which was a lot more than just a workshop. Listening to his views and his enlightened understanding gave me a
                          completely fresh insight into some fundamental TA concepts. Onwards and upwards from here!
                          </p>
                      <p style="text-align: justify;">There was so much packed into those two fun days – a powerful panel discussion, enriching
                          workshops (making it difficult to choose which ones to attend); interacting with a great bunch of fellow TA travelers, each on their paths to self-discovery and learning, a fun musical evening and an immersive soundscape experience. Everything was so professionally managed and brought together by an obviously passionate team!
                          </p>
                      <p style="text-align: justify;">I left the best for the last! What really made me smile was the absolutely delicious rasam,
                          rice, and bhindi which I devoured on both days, followed by the gooey, melt-in-your-mouth
                          payasam, that felt like a warm hug. Ah! I can go back just for that!
                          </p>
                      <p style="text-align: justify;">PS: For the next conference I invite you all to Kolkata, to spread some TA love here! Hope we can make it happen! I promise delicious food!!</p>

                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Emotions can be messy, painful, and inconvenient. Whatever you are feeling is telling you something you want, need, and value. However, there are not enough safe spaces to talk about it and there are many social stigmas around expressing/exploring emotions deeply.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">ಹೇಗಿದೀರ? is a phrase in Kannada for ‘How are you? This was the phrase that was used as a metaphor for pausing, and asking people how they are, creating safe spaces to open up, normalizing conversations around mental health and reducing the stigma around mental illness at the South Asian Association of Transactional Analysts (SAATA) this year. </p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">I had the opportunity to be a presenter and share space with many stalwarts in the space of mental health and social psychology. I presented a toolkit that I have developed called 'I'm F9' to explore emotions through Navarasa. Navarasa are 9 human emotions mentioned in the ancient Indian text Natyashashtra used in our art, dance, theatre, and literature. </p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">This toolkit can be used in both self-exploration and group sharing formats and explore concepts like learned patterns, rackets, and permissions in a playful format. The session had 60+ attendees who were mental health practitioners and trainees from various backgrounds. I was deeply moved by the openness and vulnerability of the group in exploring the tool and expressing their emotions. We started with psychodrama exercises to feel different emotions in varying intensities, following which the participants were asked to reflect in groups on emotions that they were most comfortable expressing and least comfortable expressing. Through a small sample from the 90 cards in the toolkit, the group took turns sharing stories and reflections in response to the questions, prompts, and action nudges in the cards. This enabled a gentle exploration of 9 emotions through TA concepts like learnt patterns, rackets, and permissions.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">I am still heady with joy for the opportunity to present, the generous feedback gathered from the participants, and the love I received from my TA friends.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Learning from the thoughtfully designed workshops and panel discussions.</li>
                        <li>Hearing from presenters like Aruna Gopakumar, Suriyaprakash C, Raghuram, Susan George, and Devadarshini on thought-provoking topics like : Working with Stories in Groups, The "Group" in Therapy Group, Enhancing Resilience in Children, Health Is Beyond Being Not Sick, Karma, Ego States and Script formation etc </li>
                        <li>Bumping into old friends, meeting some wonderful familiar strangers</li>
                        <li>Experiencing the magic of an event completely run by a set of volunteers.</li>
                        <li>Feeling amazed at a 100% plastic-free event which included steel refillable water bottles, cloth bags, and seed books.</li>
                        
                        
                    </ul>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">And as I am sipping hot filter kaapi in a brass davara set gifted to me at the conference, I feel grateful to be a part of this rich community that has given me so much and energized me to give back even more.</p>

                                          I was stuck in awe looking at a large in-person TA gathering for the first time in my 3 years of TA Journey. The entire conference including workshops, panel discussions, sound healing, keynote opening, and last but not least, the P.K.Saru Endowment lecture was very well planned and really thought through.

                    <p style="text-align: justify;">For the workshops, to start with, the title of HE/SHE/THEY/THEM pulled me into the workshop as I often see these salutations on various social media platforms, but I did not know what it meant.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">The workshop was fabulous and raised my awareness. The topic was presented as a thought-provoking interactive workshop, connecting the dots of daily life experiences with traditions, cultures, etc and finally culminating into how the structure of marriage and society has been formed. My awareness of gender increased so much, when earlier I viewed transgenders with sympathy, not really knowing what it meant. Post the workshop I look at every gender with empathy and realize the importance of dignity and respect that every gender should be given.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Another workshop that was my default selection while going through the list of workshops was “Leadership Model and Well-being while working for an Intergenerational Organization”</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Kabeer NV through this topic evoked childlike enthusiasm enabling me to enjoy the workshop like a story connecting my own patterns in relation to my team. He spoke about how culture can not only be driven in an organization but also in the society we live in, and how the culture in an organization or society impacts  mental health.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">I got so inspired through the workshop that I was able to derive a leadership model based on Drivers, Injunctions, and their relation to racket feelings. That was my Aha moment!</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">This conference has inspired me and motivated me to stop my procrastination, and helped me complete my TA diploma essays 🙂.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Thank you and much Gratitude to the entire team who have put in the efforts towards this workshop.</p>

                                          It was an enriching and enlightening experience. The execution of the conference and workshops was incredibly seamless. Kudos to the organising committee!

I learnt the importance of de-stigmatising mental health and gathered an in-depth knowledge about key aspects of mental health including the importance of learning to experience and express our emotions for our mental well-being.  And since I was attending a conference like this for the first time, the whole conference felt like an aha moment for me.</p>
