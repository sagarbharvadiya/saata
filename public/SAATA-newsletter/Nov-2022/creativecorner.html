                                                            Perhaps I was about two or three;<br />
                                                            I was free as the wind; nothing to hide. <br />
                                                            I shone like the sun, they worshipped me so <br />
                                                            I was magic, joy; their undisguised pride.
                                                        </p>
                                                        <p>
                                                            It mattered not if I wanted this or that <br />
                                                            Nor did it matter that I screamed or spat <br />
                                                            My smile was precious, as were my tears <br />
                                                            They were embraced equally, no one judged;
                                                        </p>
                                                        <p>…and how I basked in all that Unconditional Love!</p>
                                                        <p>
                                                            In fact, I remember, I distinctly do <br />
                                                            I’ve an album full of pictures too; <br />
                                                            Paint on my face, tantrum on the floor, <br />
                                                            I was even amusing twirling on my toes!
                                                        </p>
                                                        <p>
                                                            Look at this child, they said, this Child so Free! <br />
                                                            She’s such an absolute delight to be!
                                                        </p>
                                                        <p>
                                                            One day, (I’ve heard), I asked for a balloon; <br />
                                                            They got me hundreds to fill up the room! <br />
                                                            Bedtime stories went on for hours and hours; <br />
                                                            Only so we could cuddle under the covers.
                                                        </p>
                                                        <p>
                                                            Then sadly one day it stopped at that. <br />
                                                            Was it because I stopped shining somehow? <br />
                                                            or because the new baby had come to stay? <br />
                                                            My arms reached out for a pick-me-up <br />
                                                            but looks like I was all out of luck; <br />
                                                            their hands were full with baby and laundry <br />
                                                            and I was asked to stop being a whiny baby.
                                                        </p>
                                                        <p>
                                                            I remember how cold the tears felt on my face <br />
                                                            When they dried up sooner than they possibly could. <br />
                                                            Filled with shame, but not knowing why, <br />
                                                            It didn’t seem ok to want to cry.
                                                        </p>
                                                        <p>
                                                            Stroke me, I silently pleaded, I’m still here <br />
                                                            - your magic, your joy, your undisguised pride.
                                                        </p>
                                                        <p>
                                                            I was forgotten like the Sun, in a corner of the room <br />
                                                            All warmth and light, but never looked at too. <br />
                                                            Curled up into a tight little ball, <br />
                                                            Would I just shrivel up and die?
                                                        </p>
                                                        <p>
                                                            Days went by in a little blur, <br />
                                                            Bedtime stories replaced by silence stern, <br />
                                                            The squeals and delight were no longer for me <br />
                                                            I often felt like a non-entity.
                                                        </p>
                                                        <p>
                                                            (How I made up this Game it’s hard to recollect…), <br />
                                                            But if I wanted a hug, I gave the baby a kick <br />
                                                            They’d descend on me - like screaming banshees, <br />
                                                            But, well, if not a hug, they at least looked at me!
                                                        </p>

                                                        <p>
                                                            The hug that I needed pushed deeper inside <br />
                                                            The sadness I felt was no longer required. <br />
                                                            The Racket I made – the anger worked perfectly fine; <br />
                                                            At last, I was seen, heard and looked squarely in the eye!
                                                        </p>
                                                        <p>
                                                            This Racket worked somehow, I don’t know how <br />
                                                            But their Negative Strokes were better than no Strokes at all! <br />
                                                            I made peace with their anger, disappointment, sighs, <br />
                                                            At least I could be seen; there was no need to hide.
                                                        </p>
                                                        <p>
                                                            And so it went; on and on, <br />
                                                            Till I started to believe I was never wanted at all, <br />
                                                            There’s something wrong, I’m not Ok, <br />
                                                            And look! - they prove it to me every single day.
                                                        </p>
                                                        <p>
                                                            I became a collector, a collector of Stamps, <br />
                                                            And pasted it in my book of grand life plans. <br />
                                                            I’ll never be important, no one will care, <br />
                                                            I’m not important; can’t be happy and I shouldn’t dare!
                                                        </p>
                                                        <p>
                                                            I chose a partner, strong and stern,<br />
                                                            Who didn’t like his wife so bold; <br />
                                                            If It Wasn’t for You, I often said, and furiously so, <br />
                                                            I would be right up there dancing on stage.

                                                            In therapy I often puzzled <br />
                                                            Of how my conversations were all the same, <br />
                                                            Why Don’t You…they’d say, and offer help, <br />
                                                            Yes, but…I’d fume, that’s really no good!

                                                                I despair of how I kept circling back <br />
                                                                To the Racket of anger, and being a collector of Stamps. <br />
                                                                Now I’m tired of playing the Game; <br />
                                                                Of my relationships all ending the same, <br />

                                                                That Free Child I left far behind, <br />

                                            <p>Our human body is so beautifully designed, in a system that may seem so chaotically intertwined.</p>
                                            <p>It is science that has proven that in our every experience, thought and action, every cell in our body is impacted and thousands of neurons come to life.</p>
                                            <p>As intricate as it may seem, isn’t it fascinating?</p>
                                            <p>
                                                To know that in the stories we listen, the path we walk, the brush we pick, the friend we meet and the food we relish, each and everything impacts us and every part of our body, like a
                                                magnetic field passing from our cells to our genes, constantly reshaping us!
                                            </p>
                                            <p>Often dangling between the extremities of perspectives, are we truly deciding our lives or are we just a product of our experience?</p>
                                            <p>As inexplicable as it may seem, how liberating it is to know that, either way we still have a choice!</p>
                                            <p>The choice to heal. The choice to perceive. The choice to redefine and rewrite our stories.</p>
                                            <p>And the infinite choice to create a ripple effect for generations and more.</p>
                                            <p>The choices we make every single day from every step to our perspective, big or small, certainly constellates the unique being we are!</p>
                                            <p>In our liberation, may we remember our power.</p>

                                            <p>
                                                We are most often told what we “need to do” “should do” as tasks and targets. As crucial as it is to achieve goals and accomplish desires, are we truly fulfilled by them? Or have we accepted
                                                it one among the several normalcies, thereby minimizing the greater potential?
                                            </p>
                                            <p>The child-like joy from building sand castles is long lost as adults, building a million essentials and still not feeling truly joyous.</p>
                                            <p>We want more.</p>
                                            <p>We run in different directions to quench the thirst, like it is never attainable. Let us stop and reflect.</p>
                                            <p>What is a real accomplishment, if it is set by another?</p>
                                            <p>What is truly a success, if we can’t enjoy it?</p>
                                            <p>Here is the probable gap.</p>

                                            <p>Until we celebrate the core of our existence, what appears grand on the outside never truly reaches our soul.</p>
                                            <p>Celebrate another just the way they are and watch them bloom inevitably and beautifully in a hundred million ways.</p>
                                            <p>
                                                Disregard the value of the self and you will see huge accomplishments that are seemingly great on the outside, not seeping anywhere beyond the surface. It is time we attune ourselves to the
                                                hidden truth: We are the potential that we are in search of!
                                            </p>
                                            <p>Let us look beyond the illusion, embrace ourselves at our core being and enjoy growth to its true essence.</p>
                                            <p>Undeniably and powerfully, it all begins from the self!</p>
